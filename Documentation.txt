# Introduction
EDA.ipynb:
This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for our project. It is designed to provide insights into the dataset's structure, uncover any underlying patterns, and identify potential issues with data quality or completeness.

lstm-final.ipynb:
This notebook details the development and validation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model aimed at predicting next words in Joke. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final predictions.

# System Requirements

**Required Software:**
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook

**Required Libraries:**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn (only for EDA.ipynb)
- tensorflow (only for lstm-final.ipynb)

# Installation Instructions

# Setting up your environment

Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [git@github.com:Sharmisha9/NLP-Project.git]
cd [git@github.com:Sharmisha9/NLP-Project.git]

# To install the required Python libraries, run the following command in your terminal: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow

# Download the datasets from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes]. Input data format is csv.
# My project has two dataset csv files - jokes.csv has 231657 rows and shortjokes.csv has 100000 rows. Based on your computational resources choose the specific dataset.

# Executing the Notebooks
EDA.ipynb: Run all cells sequentially to perform the exploratory data analysis. Adjust parameters in the cells if necessary to suit your data specifics.
lstm-final.ipynb: Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and view the predictions. Ensure that each cell is executed in order, especially the ones involving data loading and preprocessing.

# Understanding Output and Results
Outputs in EDA.ipynb include summaries and visualizations, which help in assessing the distribution, trends, and anomalies in the data.
Outputs in lstm-final.ipynb include the model's performance metrics like accuracy and loss over training epochs, as well as the final prediction results visualized through appropriate plots.
