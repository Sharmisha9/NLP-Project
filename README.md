# Next words prediction in Joke

Objective: Use NLP techniques and choose a model that predicts the next words in a joke, particularly focusing on generating humourous or contextually relevant content and also explore how models can be effectively used in the filed of computational humor.

In this project, I implemented a LSTM model on a dataset containing jokes. The primary goal was to understand the limitations of LSTM models in generating jokes compared to more advanced models lie GGPTs. Additionally, I explored improvements that could enhance the preformance of LSTM models in generating humorous content.

See the documentation for more details.
